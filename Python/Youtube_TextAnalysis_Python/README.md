## Introduction
YouTube is one of the largest platforms for user-generated content, and analyzing its comments can provide valuable insights into user sentiment, engagement, and trends. This project uses Python to process and analyze YouTube comments, focusing on:
- Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral)
- Emoji frequency analysis
- Relationships between views, likes, and comments

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies comments as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Emoji Analysis**: Extracts and visualizes the most frequently used emojis.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Analyzes relationships between metrics like views, likes, and comments.
- **Database Integration**: Stores processed data in an SQLite database for efficient querying.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `plotly` for interactive visualizations
  - `sqlite3` and `sqlalchemy` for database management
  - `textblob` for sentiment analysis
  - `emoji` for emoji extraction
- **Database**: SQLite

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YouTube_TextAnalysis.git
   cd YouTube_TextAnalysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Place your YouTube comments dataset (e.g., `UScomments.csv`) in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook youtube_analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and clean the data.
   - Perform sentiment analysis.
   - Visualize emoji frequency and other metrics.
   - Store and query data using SQLite.

3. Export results:
   - Processed data is saved in the `export_data/` directory as CSV and SQLite files.

## Results
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Majority of users express positive sentiments, with frequent use of emojis like ‚ù§Ô∏è, üòÇ, and üòç.
- **Emoji Frequency**: The most common emojis reflect user engagement and sentiment.
- **EDA**: Strong correlation observed between likes and views.
